# What this application does

The gist of this django api is to provide a simple way to manage user logins in your app using JWT. On purpose, it provides very limited capabilities so that it's as reusable as possbile. This version of the authentication API is designed to be used in managed systems, thus the removal of self-serve password resets and the addition of admin password reset. Here's a quick API endpoint rundown:

## POST routes

### `/auth`
* Requires `username` and `password` to be set in the body of the request in json
* Returns a json with a `status` and a `jwt` field, also sets a `jwt_token` cookie

### `/register`
* Requires `username`, `password` and `email` to be set in the body of the request in json
* Returns a json with `status` and `data` fields. The `data` field contains data of the format:
```
"data": {
		    "userID": int,
		    "username": String
	    }
```

### `/update_profile`
* Takes either a `password` or a `email` (or both) in the body of the request in json form. Also requries a valid `jwt_token` cookie to be sent along with the request
* Returns a json with a `status` field

### `/renew_token`
